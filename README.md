React Address Book

We have provided some simple React template code below. Your goal is to make it work. It is a simple form that allows the user to enter in a first name, last name, and address. Once the submit button is pressed, the information should be displayed in a list below along with all the previous information that was entered. This way the application can function as a simple address book.
